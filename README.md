Testing overview
Concerning the unit tests written for the files within our code, we proceeded by first defining the kinds of tests required to give a functioning overview of the code. This was determined by our user stories and gherkin scripts. We broke our units tests into two distinct criterias: those testing the api requests and those testing the mapping of the object ids into the api request data. The primary function used to test these relationships was the “assert” function.

To evaluate are use of the TDD (Test Driven Development) method, we respected the red-green refractory cycle in that the tests were written prior to compiling any working code or pseudo code. Where we strayed from this method was that we then reviewed the pseudo code that had been written in the first sprint, adapting our tests accordingly. Obvious limitations in our following the TDD method were that due to time constraints in the project the tests were written in conjunction with the code so there was an evident need for adaption of the tests. This however was not overly problematic in that the 
To conclude with the results of our tests…
